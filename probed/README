NAME

probed(8) - A simple QOS probe

SYNOPSIS

probed [ -c config-file ] [ -d debug-level ] [ -e ] [ -f ] [ -g ] [ -h history-file ] [ -i packet_count ] [ -l logfile ] [ -p port ] [ -t timeout ] [ -u user ] [-v ] [ remote-system ]

DESCRIPTION

        probed is a lightweight probe daemon that may be utilized to determine rudimentary QOS metrics between the system the probe operates on and a second system. It may be queried through a port or invoked in a single use from the command line by specifying the remote-system as an IP address or a hostname. If remote_system is not specified, probed runs in the background as a daemon.

        probed sends -i packets to the remote host as rapidly as possible and computes the latency, jitter, and packet loss. The configuration file can set a maximum number of packets, max_packets, to moderate potential abuse.

        probed then returns a computed Mean Opinion Score (MOS) score between 1 and 5, with 1 being the lowest, and 5 being the highest. This score is computed from the jitter, latency, and packet loss.  The latency, jitter, and loss are based on the following, which may be overridden in probed.conf:

        excellent = 5
        good = 4
        fair = 3
        poor = 2
        bad = 1

Latency thresholds:
        latency_excellent       <50ms
        latency_good            50 - 100ms
        latency_fair            150-300ms
        latency_poor            >300ms

Jitter thresholds
        jitter_excellent                0-10ms
        jitter_good             10-20ms
        jitter_fair             20-50ms
        jitter_poor             >50ms

Loss thresholds
        loss_excellent          0-0.5%
        loss_good               0.5-1.5%
        loss_fair               1.5-2%
        loss_poor               >2%

        The default sample size for probed is 10 icmp packets. This may be changed using the -e and -i options or by setting OPTIONS=ECHO or ITERATIONS=n


OPTIONS

-c config-file
Use config-file as the configuration file instead of the default, /etc/probed.conf. To ensure that the reloading the configuration file continues to work after the server has changed its working directory due to a possible directory option in the config file, config-file should be an absolute pathname.

-d debug-level
Set the daemon's debug level to debug-level. Debugging traces from probed become more verbose as te the debugging level increases.

-e
Use the tcp echo port rather than icmp. Send the
string 'echo_string' to the echo port.

 -f
Run the server in the foreground (i.e. do not
daemonize).

 -g
Run  the  server  in  the  foreground  and  force all
logging to stderr.

-h history-file
Gather probe queries and results in history-file. The format of history-file is:

Month date time hostname process_name[pid]: QUERY=remote_host (or host ip address) RESULT='result string from query'

        EXAMPLE:

Jun 6 04:30:06 queryhost probed[3466]: QUERY=host.example.net RESULT='3.4'

-i packet count
Each probe of the remote end should involve at least i iterations. Values less than 3 are ignored.

-l logfile
        Log all commands, sources, and results to logfile.
Different from history file in that it contains a log
of all traffic, not just queries.

-p port
        Listen on port for queries rather than the default of 665.

-t timeout
        Do not let queries exceed timeout milliseconds.

-u user
setuid() to user after completing privileged
operations, such as creating sockets that listen on
privileged ports.

-v
        Report the version number to stdout and exit.

COMMANDS AND ACTIONS

The following are plain text commands that may be sent to probed and appropriate responses. Each it terminated with a \n:

        HELO myhostname - Specify who is placing the query.
Required as first command.

        PACKETS=[ number ] - How many packets to send. Not required.

        QUERY=[hostname] or [ip address] - Query the following host. Required

        VERBOSE=ON - Turn verbose mode on. Not required. Verbose mode modifies the returned information to a QUERY.

        OPTIONS=[] - Reserved for later options that probed may specify. Not Required.

        BYE - Terminate the session. Required.

The actions taken and response to the above commands are:

        HELO myhostname\n

Returns:

                        WELCOME myhostname\n  - myhostname passes authentication
or
                        DENIED myhostname\n  - myhostname fails authentication
and the session terminated.

        PACKETS=[ number ] \n

Returns:

                        PACKETS=[ number ]\n - How many packets will be sent.

        QUERY=[remote_hostname] or [remote_ip_address]\n

                Returns:

                        If VERBOSE=OFF returns
                                MOS=[ 1.0 - 5.0, -1.0 ]\n
Where MOS is a score between 1.0 and 5.0.
Returns -1.0 if an error occurred.
                        If VERBOSE=ON
                                MOS=[ 1.0 - 5.0 ], JITTER=[ jitter in ms],
LATENCY=[ latency in ms ],
LOSS=[ n.n percent packet loss ]\n
Where MOS is a score and other potentially
valuable information.

        VERBOSE=[null,ON,OFF]\n

                Returns:

VERBOSE=[ON,OFF]\n - Returns ON or OFF to confirm change.
If command is null, returns current VERBOSE status.

        OPTIONS=[DEFAULT,options to be determined, null]\n


Returns:

OPTIONS=[DEFAULT]\n reset options to default and return
 'DEFAULT'
If command is [ options ] return options confirmed.
If command is null, return currently set options

        BYE
                Returns:

BYE and close connection.

SIGNALS

In routine operation, signals may be used to control probed.

SIGHUP - Force a reload of the server.

        SIGINT, SIGTERM - Shut down the server.

        The result of sending any other signals to probed is undefined.

 CONFIGURATION
        The probed configuration file follows standard config file rules and is documented inline. The example config file /etc/probed.conf is:

#       probed.conf - probed config file
#
# Access section
# by default, access to probed is denied to all hosts. Hostnames, domains,
# specific ip addresses and ip address ranges may all be permitted specifically.
# This should change to a secured method as soon as possible.
#

allow 127.0.0.1 # Allow specific IP address
allow localhost         # Allow hostname
allow 204.130.216/24    # Allow IP address range
allow 192.168.1.1       # Allow specific host
allow example.com       # Allows all hosts in example.com

FILES
        /etc/probed.conf        - probed configuration file

        /var/log/probed.hx      - probed history

BUGS
        Probed is rudimentary at best. There is much improvement to be had. The next version should be capable of being a client server based model.
