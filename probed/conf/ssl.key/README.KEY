 where PEM-encoded RSA Private Keys for SSL are stored.

 Per default the following files are provided:

   This is the server private key, configured with the
   SSLCertificateKeyFile directive.
   
   To remove password phrase from the key:
   $ openssl rsa -in server.key -out server-nopass.key

 by running the command (a pass phrase may be queried):
