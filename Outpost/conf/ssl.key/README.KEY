 This is the ssl.key/ directory for Outpost SSL extensions
 where PEM-encoded RSA Private Keys for SSL are stored.

 Per default the following files are provided:

 o outpost.key:
   This is the server private key, configured with the
   SSLCertificateKeyFile directive.
   
   To remove password phrase from the key:
   $ openssl rsa -in outpost.key -out outpost-nopass.key

 You can view the ingredients of a particular private key file in plain text
 by running the command (a pass phrase may be queried):

   $ openssl rsa -noout -text -in <name>.key
